1942 Sunday.  It was wonderful to have Tom back again.  He looked well, & had but one headache while away.

 

It was just as tho we took the trip with him, so vividly did he describe it all – Returned by Bus, sidetracked for 4 hours because of deep snows – Left Seattle 1:00 P.M. Wed, reached Topeka 1:00 P. M. Saturday.  Paul Pennington & Tom applied at Boeings Defense air o’plane plant there.  Tom worked there, but decided to return to Topeka.

January 8

 

Thurs 1942  Tom called at Don’s office to take me home in the car, as weather was “bitingly” cold.  Thurs. is my afternoon off, we paid our bills, then came to our home where Annie, Tom & I spent afternoon playing “Contact,”  We had such a fine visit.

 

Letter from Bessie today: told about Custer being asked to be “King” at “Eros” Ball (God of Love)” at the Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  He was very grateful for the honor but declined – The Kings” robes & gifts to the Queen Etc would cost about $500.00, Bessie said -- & everything very formal – Custers daughter Dot was chosen as Maid to the Queen at this same Ball: but she didn’t know her father might have been King – But it didn’t all come to pass because Mardi Gras was cancelled on acct of Defense Program against Japan who attacked Pearl Harbor & Manila Dec 7 – 1941

January 9

 

1942 Friday  I bought a small chest of drawers, (three drawers) at Crosbys. 

 

For a long time, I had wanted such a chest to assemble all my notes, paper, clippings etc in, so they could easily be located & filed away systematically.  So this solved the problem.  I have it in our living room, so it will always be accessible.

1942 Sunday:  Passed the Sunday in the usual manner: home duties until afternoon, then Annie & I read and listen to an interesting Radio program.

 

Don & Bill didn’t come over as they often do – Don studying on professional papers

1942 Sunday  Spent the evening with Ruth and Tom.  We played “Contact,” visited & almost forgot to come home.

 

Ruth served a delightful lunch consisting of hot chocolate, fruit gelatin salad & angel food cake.

 

Don & Bill came over about 5:30 bringing fudge ripple ice cream.  They were each eating cones.  We look ford to their visits one can always learn so much in listening to Don.

 

Once, Mr Diesem, Custer’s father who always attended State legislature, said Don was the most interesting one to visit with that he’d ever known

1942 Tuesday.  In evening worked for three and a half hours on Don’s Income Tax Sheet.

 

Income Tax for folks will be terrific this year, because we are at war with Japan, Germany & Italy.

 

You see, U. States is trying to “cover the globe” like the Sherman paint Co does.  We are one tiny nation & the rest of the world is so extensive it just doesn’t seem logical or “make sense” for Roosevelt to think we can guard two big oceans & all the European countries.  His mother once said he was a great spender & always wanted his way, & she would know.

 

[Page 21]

 

January 21

 

1942 Wed: - Bright winter’s day:  walked as far as the Grace Cathedral Church, then the folks came by in their car, so I rode the rest of the way to the office

 

5:30 Wed Eve.  Appointment for ‘Shampoo’ at Beauty Parlor, so I relaxed there for about 2 hours.  After leaving the shop, I went to the Cozy to see the picture “So Ends Our Night.”

 

Leading roles played by Margaret Sullivan & Frederick March.  Twas a picture somewhat like “The Mortal Storm” in which Miss Sullivan played with James Stewart in that it dealt with war problems of refugees in Europe: people fleeing from the “Madman” of Europe the Hitler regime.

 

[Page 22]

 

January 22

 

1942 Thursday:  Another pretty day.  Spent my afternoon off resting at home by our big bay window which we call our solarium.

 

So much light & sunshine enters there.  Mother had the bay window with its tile floor made to house flowers of which she was so fond

 

[Page 23]

 

January 23

 

1942 Friday.  Frank Atkinson was buried.  Enroute from Chicago to Los Angeles, he was unable to continue trip further than Topeka, Ks. where for several months, he staid at the home of his sister Mrs. Fred Morns.

 

The body was cremated, so Mrs Morns took part of the flowers home, giving some Gladiolas to Ruth, who sent us out a generous boquet by Tom.

 

[Page 24]

 

January 24

 

Saturday:  We had a very busy morning at the office which we appreciated.

 

Because of so many young men taken into Service, we are not quite as busy as usual.

 

Don tho is busy planning Ethical program for our profession to establish & Sunday Dr Davis, Optometrist spent several hours at Dons home in assisting.

 

Billy Don had a cold Sunday but is in school again on Monday

 

[Page 25]

 

January 25

 

Sunday again – how quickly it returns.  Annie & I broke the morning’s routine by taking a mornings walk prior to making our beds.

 

Somehow the day fills itself in so quickly, that our walk is missed unless taken early

 

Annie regilded our frame on the Adobe’ Oil paintings.  It so refreshed looking

 

I mended some articles, read a book Don loaned on “Exhalation” – 5:30 Don visited us awhile bringing ice cream which we saved until Tom came.  Tom took dinner with us, and played contact -- then Mr ____ came for Don and they went to Toms home.

January 26

 

1942 Monday:  Oh’ boy some good Victories for the Allies today – Some American soldiers also reached Ireland

 

Gen’l McArthur is making such strenuous efforts to hold on in the Phillipines, seem as tho our soldiers should go to him first.  Those islands are islands of Americas

 

Worked on Income Tax tonite.

 

[Page 27]

Tuesday.  Yanks land in Ireland the morning paper said and a Japanese Aircraft Carrier. Sunk we think.

 

Lots of nice sunshine today.

 

As Annie went to a class at Y.W.C.A, she came to the office & suggested we stay down town.

 

We dined at Senate Cafeteria then went to see Anna Nagel, the English actress in Sunny.  It was a story about New Orleans – Madri Gras.  She is very versatile, Lovely, graceful & wonderful dancer & can sing too.  Her pardner was like Fred Astaire.

It was a wonderful night, almost clear as day time, & quite chilly.  Tom tho was warmly dressed, looked happy and quite handsome, thrilled in a way in his quest of new work

 

We gave him $5.00 for a Valentine gift, little in advance of the day tho, & wished him safe & happy trip.

1942 Thurs:  In evening Annie & I went to the Grand Theatre to see Nelson Eddy & Rise’ Stevens in Chocolate Soldier.  It was splendid.

 

Mr Nelson never disappoints you in his singing and Miss Stevens should have a brilliant career.

Beautiful voice, charming manners & such an alluring smile, graceful & has histrionic ability – lovely hair and very even teeth, bright eyes, and coquetish.  We thought we might miss Jeanette McDonald, Mr Nelson’s former singing pardner.  But Miss Stevens voice & performance dissypated that & made a pleasant evening to which we will often look back.

 

In afternoon Claire went to Dr Isermans – teeth cleaned & one filled

At 5:30 our two “faithful gentlemen” Don & Bill, his grandson, made their Sunday evening appearance bringing ice cream to the ladies as usual.

 

We visited interestingly about war conditions, about what we thought are the mistakes our government, under F. D. Roosevelt (our Pres.) is making.  Just throwing “money to winds” without thought of the future and policing the four cornors of the world leaving our country so unguarded.

We came home from office in Don’s car driving only about 10 miles per hour because of the sleet.

1942 Thurs:  Usual Xmas excitement prevailed thruout the day.  In the office, some of our patients now serving their country but home on a Xmas furlo, came in for examinations or adjustments of glasses, we were pleased to see them.

1942 Saturday, the day after Xmas – when I started to the office about 8:30 it was almost dark.  Gentle rain & mist & fog made our weather a close-down – Visibility dropped to four or five blocks & according to our weather bureau at noon the ceiling was zero.  Flight operations at the Top. Army base were halted – A little lightening & thunder.  Oh so quiet everywhere; few cars only in evidence – our lovely T.H.S. Bldg was enveloped in a grey mist & resembled with its beautiful tower, the parliament bldg in London, England.
