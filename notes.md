# Week Six Notes

## Readings

### http://historyinthecity.blogspot.com/2013/11/before-i-start-i-want-to-thank-people.html
- *"Feminist Artists and Network Analysis"* : This seems like a really interesting topic to explore and analyze... I can see how the tools we have learned about over the last few weeks would enhance this venture.
- *"corpus linguistics might reveal interesting aspects of her as female artist in a largely male milieu."* : a reoccurring theme in our studies...
- I do not fully understand that first vizualization but I can appreciate the complexity and odd beauty of it. It seems to be a timeline of sorts. 
- The following breakdown of simpler vizualizations definetly make more sense and give more insight as to what the author is trying to explore.
- I really liked how she broke down her process of analyzation. It was especialy cool that I now recognize most of the tools and concepts mentioned.
- I wont lie, I was actually impressed that I understood most of what she was saying. It really shows how much I've learned over these past few weeks. The included vizualizations helped alot as well.
- Her text ends in a question: *"I also really wanted to talk about data visualization as a tool in DH.  The above two images show the same data represented two ways.  The lower is Gephi, the "hot" tool of network analysis, while the top is the relatively easy to use Raw interface.  Which seems clearer? "*
    - To answer this I have to say the first vizualziation, made through raw, is more clear to me. Even tho upon first glance it seems more complex due to all the extra "parts" it is easier to read because there is not much to interpret. The lines show direct correlations, where as the "network diagram" (of sorts) is more messy and up to interpretation to me.
    
## Final Task

### What source did I choose?

**Instructions:** Remember back in week one, how I had you explore that twitter thread by Amalia Skarlatou Levi? This week, you’ll be selecting one of those resources she shared (or, if none strike your fancy, something from the resources gathered here) to do some exploratory digital history.

From the "Diary Index" (https://diaryindex.com/digitized-diaries/) provided, I have selected Claire Eva Paine's Diary (https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/228565) to explore and analyze. I can not exactly put my finger on why, but It seemed interesting to explore something I have virtually no knowledge about. I find it interesting that she is not a major "historical figure" and from first glance, the book is mearly her simple day to day thoughts as an average working woman. I will see if I can find any patterns in her enteries.

### What will I do with my source?

**Instructions:** You will use at least three appropriate techniques from weeks 1 to 4 to identify and surface some interesting historical observations from those sources, and you will imagine the possible directions such research might take.

Much like the reading we did for this week, I think my main goal will be to download her diary (either the images or the already inscripted text available), clean the text up and then analyze and interpret it using various tools to see if there are any patterns that can be visualized. 

**Step 1: Downloading the Text**

- I was having difficulty at the beginning and getting a whole bunch of error messages, but after refering back to my week one notes, I realize now that the "wget.exe" file needs to be in the directory that I am downloading things into. I am hoping this works...
- An improvement... It did download but not how I wanted it to... I think it has something to do with the URL. I will try something else.
- Its odd, I felt I followed the steps but no matter what I did it seems to not download the individual images but made an index page of sorts? I have attached pictures of my attempts.

**This is the link of the first journal page/what I assumed was directory:**

**This is the code I used to (unsuccessfully) download the images:**

You will share your results using an appropriate technique you encountered in week 5. Other possibilities are ok too; just check with Dr. Graham first. Remember, you don’t have a lot of time, so keep your ambitions in check: the perfect is the enemy of the good.
